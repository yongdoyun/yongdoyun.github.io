## Variance Reduction Techniques(VRT)

### Introduction

MC caluclations can be time-consuming, especially for applications in RT.  
Therefore, algorithm techiniques to speed up the simulations are essestial.  
These techniques are called **VRT**.  

Following contents are written from the point of view of photon-electron interactions. However, the same concepts can be applied for heavy charged and neutral particles.
